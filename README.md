# Smookify

Plays random parts of songs from weekly listening quiz list for Popular Music class at JHU (AS.376.242).

Each week, we have a listening quiz that tests song name, artist, genre, and year. I made this app as a studying tool for this purpose.

Built before Spotify came out with a JS Web Player SDK, rip.
